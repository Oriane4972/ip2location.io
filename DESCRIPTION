Description: A system for submitting multiple IP information queries to IP2Location.ioâ€™s IP Geolocation API and storing the resulting data in a CSV file. You provide a vector of IP addresses, your IP2Location.io API key, and the base URL <https://api.ip2location.io/>. The package returns a CSV file with one row per IP address and a column for each data field included in your API plan. This is the first submission of the package to CRAN.
